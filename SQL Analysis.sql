-- QUESTION:
-- 1.	What's the total revenue and profitability of the dataset? (entire dataset, 2020 and 2021)

SELECT
    SUM(CASE WHEN EXTRACT(YEAR FROM STR_TO_DATE(invoice_date, '%d/%m/%Y')) = 2020 THEN total_sales ELSE 0 END) AS revenue_2020,

-- 2. Which states drive the most revenue and have high profitability?
SELECT state, 
	SUM(total_sales) AS revenue, 
	SUM(operating_profit) AS profit
FROM sales.adidas_us
GROUP BY state
ORDER BY revenue DESC;

    -- 3. Are there any states that consistently show higher operating margins? 
SELECT

-- 4. Are certain sales methods consistently more profitable?
-- â€¢	Overall sales by selling method

ORDER BY sales_method, invoice_year;

-- 5.	Is high sales volume correlated with high profits? 0.892 close to +1 => possitive correlation
SELECT
    (COUNT(*) * SUM(units_sold * operating_profit) - SUM(units_sold) * SUM(operating_profit)) /
    SQRT((COUNT(*) * SUM(units_sold * units_sold) - SUM(units_sold) * SUM(units_sold)) *

-- 7. Product
-- Top selling product and highest profitability entire dataset
